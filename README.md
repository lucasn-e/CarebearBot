# CarebearBot
The parrot bot for anonymous complaints/suggestions in your discord server.

## What can it do
Well. Not much. It basically just copies messages from one channel into another and deletes the original,
resulting in anonymous messages sitting in the target channel.

## How to use
!care help - displays the massive list of TWO whole commands
!care target - defines the current channel as target channel. all messages will be directed here
!care source - defines the current channel as source channel. all messages from here will be deleted and sent to the target channel
