# CarebearBot
The parrot bot for anonymous complaints/suggestions in your discord server.

## What can it do
Well. Not much. It basically just copies messages from one channel into another and deletes the original,
resulting in anonymous messages sitting in the target channel.

## How to use
```!care help``` - displays the massive list of THREE whole commands


```!care target``` - defines the current channel as target channel. all messages will be directed here


```!care source``` - defines the current channel as source channel. all messages from here will be deleted and sent to the target channel


```!care setrole``` - defines your current role to be the bot admin role. other roles cannot use bot commands.
